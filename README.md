### What is this?
This is a sample plugin starter based on WP docs (procedural style).
Sample plugin settings are added (text field, text area and images). It creates two tables in the db. If this is not required, edit dorotas-plugin-starter.php before installing.
Plugin settings have their own link in admin menu (as opposed to link as part of Settings submenu).

### Instalation
Download, move to your plugins directory and install as usual.
